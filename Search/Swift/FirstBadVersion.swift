// The code base version is an integer start from 1 to n. One day, someone committed a bad version in the code case, so it caused this version and the following versions are all failed in the unit tests. Find the first bad version.

// You can call isBadVersion to help you determine which version is the first bad one. The details interface can be found in the code's annotation part.

// Example
// Given n = 5:

//     isBadVersion(3) -> false
//     isBadVersion(5) -> true
//     isBadVersion(4) -> true

// Here we are 100% sure that the 4th version is the first bad version.
// Challenge
// You should call isBadVersion as few as possible.

// Notice
// Please read the annotation in code area to get the correct way to call isBadVersion in different language. For example, Java is SVNRepo.isBadVersion(v)

/**
 * public class SVNRepo {
 *     public static boolean isBadVersion(int k);
 * }
 * you can use SVNRepo.isBadVersion(k) to judge whether 
 * the kth code version is bad or not.
*/
public class Solution {
  /**
   * @param n: An integer
   * @return: An integer which is the first bad version.
