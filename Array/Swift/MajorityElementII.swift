// Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

// Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

// Example 1:

// Input: [3,2,3]
// Output: [3]
// Example 2:

// Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
// Output: [1,2]

class Solution {
    func majorityElement(_ nums: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        
    }
