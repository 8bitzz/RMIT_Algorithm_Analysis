// Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

// Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

// Example:

// Input:
// [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

// Output:
// 2

// Explanation:
// The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]

class Solution {
    public int numberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {
        
    }
