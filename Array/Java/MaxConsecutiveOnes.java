// Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

// Example 1:
// Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
//     The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
// Note:

// The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
// The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
