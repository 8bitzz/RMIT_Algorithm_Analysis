// Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

// Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

// Example 1:

// Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

// Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

// It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
// Example 2:

// Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

// Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

// It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
// Clarification:

// Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

// Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

// Internally you can think of this:

// // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
// int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
// for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
//     print(nums[i]);
// }
